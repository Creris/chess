# C++ Chess
Chess made in C++ as a fun side project.

## TODO
* ~~CLI to make it playable~~
* Rules left to implement:
  * ~~Check~~
  * ~~Checkmate~~
  * ~~Stalemate~~
  * ~~Castling~~
  * ~~En Passant~~
  * ~~50 move rule~~
  * ~~3-fold repetition~~
  * All chess rules are now implemented!

Some more optimizations to come.

More thorough readme comes once main functionality is implemented.

## Plans for future
* AI using Monte-Carlo algorithm
* Shogi implementation
* 2D Graphics
* Audio
* Multiplayer?
